Known to sailors as literally, “The Good Sea” it brought a boon of commerce between G&#39dush and the grand, sprawling cities that used to crowd against the edge of the ring. </p><p>Of course, these edge cities are long gone. So thorough was their destruction after the era changed not even their names remain. </p><p>The Vestian Sea harbors exuberant fauna and colorful and carefree flora. There is little danger here, and an overall attitude of sun, smiles, and the simple-life prevails.</p><p>Of course, this peace did not come easily. These waters are fiercely protected by sirens, water weirds, elementals, hell even schools of predatory fish patrol the sea to keep it as idyllic as ever. Ill-wishers on the sea are executed without trial. Littering here carries a death sentence. </p><p>Despite the danger, the peaceful shores and fragrant ocean air make this a great vacation spot for those willing to abide by the rule. Leave no trace.</p>';

			case "angreifen":
				article.innerHTML = '<h1>Angreifen Sea</h1><p>The Angreifen Sea is a terror. Sailors swear it&#39s alive, and some worship it to keep their ships afloat. Its untapped depths hold horrors unknown. Its terrifying storms can spring up in an instant. Its powerful currents divert ships and keep the entire sea absolutely frigid. </p><p>Of course, the sea isn’t actually alive. Though the water elementals that call it home may argue, there is no being in control of this sea’s terror. It&#39s all science! You see the Angreifen was made to be the deepest sea after a portal into the Underdark collapsed, bringing several thousand miles of tunnels and caves into the material plane. These structures collapsed under the weight of the primordial sea, and we’re left with the deep, frigid sea we know today.</p><p>But that’s only half the story. Enter Velho Mal, the only active volcanic system in the entire plane. This belching trio of islands perpetually generate hot, dry air and warm waters that, when clashed with the frigid sea beyond, create monstrous storms. Pair that with a usually warm and dry summer, and you can start to see why it’s been nicknamed Storm Mother by the dwarves of Festung and Créche Tempête by the scholars of Daigaku.</p><p>Little has been explored of its vast depths. After the horrors found in the deep of the Water Plane, most researchers decided it wasn’t worth finding out. Those crazy enough to venture deep, and lucky enough to come back, tell stories of vast underwater caverns filled with unimaginably beautiful creatures that dance in the watery light of gigantic glowing jellyfish. In the same breath these adventurers will also describe a gigantic creature that uses its ribs to grab and dismember prey. It’s good to remember the balancing rule of nature, for everything breathtakingly beautiful, there is something equally horrific. </p>';

			case "ost":
				article.innerHTML = '<h1>Ost Sea</h1><p>The Ost Sea has long been nicknamed the “Sea of Curses.” I mean, Gaifal&#39s Folly and both Cursed Isles are all here. Despite its neighbors, the Ost Sea is quite calm. Due to the curse on Gaifal&#39s Folly, the sea is drawn in predictable, peaceful patterns. It&#39s not too deep either. Without much geologic activity for several eras, the bottom of the Ost Sea is a plain, boring old desert dotted with the odd coral reef. </p><p>Wildlife in the area has suffered due to the corruption of the Cursed Isles, but data shows the effect to be slowly fading. Either way, the Ost Sea is a warm, calm ocean sparser than most. About as lame as an ocean can be. But not the lamest. That illustrious title goes to the Vertei Sea.</p>';

			case "vertei":
				article.innerHTML = '<h1>Vertei Sea</h1><p>What is there even to say man. This ENTIRE OCEAN is 20ft deep at its deepest. That&#39s it. Lake Vash is deeper. </p><p>To describe the Vertei Sea is to describe a tepid swimming pool. Its shores are small cliffs that immediately start you in about 3ft of water, then it rolls and rolls for what seems like eternity. The water is near stagnant and crystal clear. This makes it the ideal place for large schooling fish to swarm in masses, and indeed they do. The most interesting thing you&#39ll see out here is the miles wide schools that meander from seagrass patch to seagrass patch. There are few predators, but the ones that do patrol are to be respected. See Sandshark and Flatailed Stiltbird for more details.</p><p>Why is it like this? The First Elemental War of course! With no natural geologic activity the Material Plane relies on mainly earth elementals to shape its lands. And shape they did. During the war, water elementals used this sea as a base of operations. This was still during the first era, so the God of Earth at the time was, to put it gently, not smart. </p><p>They decided to finish this war once and for all by completely filling the enemy base with rocks. Their plan to end the war. Was to fill in the ocean. And I&#39ll be damned. That crazy son of a bitch pulled it off.      They lost the war.</p><p>However! That long forgotten god&#39s testament to the obdurate nature of the humble earth elemental has stood the test of time. Their resolute nature even in the face of certain defeat is deeply commendable, and this monument to their power isn’t even HALF as impressive as the mountains I mean come on dude Mount Cydical reaches halfway up the plane and houses countless gem dragons. This ocean blows.</p>';

As such, it made its fortune shipping ore and timber downstream. And what a fortune it was.</p><p>Having essentially a monopoly on all the resources for an entire half of a plane leads to the accumulation of a bit of wealth. And what do you do with wealth? Build really sick vanity buildings of course! G&#39Dush soon became the center of culture and art and its towering skyscrapers pierced the heavens. For reference to the sheer vastness of the wealth generated here, the entirety of Daigaku Hall was constructed from the bankroll of exactly one company.</p><p>Of course, gilded cities always have a rotten center. The tri-opoly of corporations that owned the city ruled with an iron fist. Anti-competitive tactics were rampant in the industry and workers bore the brunt of these attacks. Class divides were laughably extreme. The elite even built a new road system suspended 20ft in the air to avoid interacting with their workers. G&#39Dush was essentially two cities, and luck determined which one you lived in.</p><p>In the end its exuberance was its downfall. At the turn of the era G&#39Dush sealed itself to the world, banking on stockpiled resources to make it through what was thought to be just a bad few years. But those bad few years happened to be just a bad few months. A worker&#39s revolt known as Red Winter saw the execution of each company&#39s president and board of directors. New leadership was shaky, and unable to stand against the tides of planar invaders.</p><p>Soon the gates were torn asunder and the city was looted for all it was worth. Within just a decade after the era change the city was essentially leveled. Today, the hollowed bones of bygone buildings warn against the viciousness of greed.</p>';

			case "gaifal":
				article.innerHTML = '<h1>Gaifal&#39s Folly</h1><p>Who&#39s Gaifal? Not important. These are the ruins of the once great capital of the Ostodaifal Empire. Who are they? Not important. These ruins were destroyed by an ancient water elemental named Dropour. Why did they destroy it? Not important.</p><p>What IS important is why wizards and other magic-folk still travel to it. You see Dropour&#39s spell has somehow manifested itself into some kind of self-perpetuating curse. Originally, Dropour simply wanted to use his mastery of magic to destroy the city, originally named Ostedge, with a giant wave. And they did! A single 100ft wave came crashing down on Ostedge, completely leveling anything not made of stone. </p><p>Originally, the ancient denizens of Ostedge planned to just stay. The keep and the walls were still up, so what was there to worry about? Well, the next day another wave came. And then another. Day after day veritable tsunamis battered the ruined walls of Ostedge.</p><p>After not even 3 days the entire empire was out for Dropour&#39s head. And they got it the very next day. Being that they were in a deep meditative trance, the warriors of Ostodaifal had no problem dispatching Dropour. But the waves never stopped. In fact, they began to increase in frequency. Soon the now ruined Ostedge was getting doused by several giant waves daily, but that wasn’t all. Coral began to grow unnaturally quick on the thrashed brickwork. Fish began swimming out of the sea and into the air as if there was no difference. Standing in what was once a bustling marketplace a week ago was now like standing at the bottom of the ocean. </p><p>But why? Well dear reader, no one knows. Scholars and wizards and all types are still making research missions to the ruin to try and find out why the sea has continued to lay stake to this ruin. What sort of magic is sustaining this ecosystem? Why did the waves stop increasing in frequency? Are the fish flying, or still swimming? </p><p>Many unanswered questions. However, here&#39s one more. Why are spells more powerful inside the ruin? </p><p>Inside the walls of Gaifal&#39s Folly is some magical source that increases the effectiveness of spells. No matter the caster, spell, casting method, or deity the spell is always stronger than even if it was cast right outside the walls. This feature makes the ruin a boon to magical research since the boosted base power helps casters practice higher level spells that they might not have been able to cast otherwise. Professor Kyoju has reportedly been able to cast an 11th level spell here. The gods were not pleased.</p>';

			case "cragna":
				article.innerHTML = '<h1>Cragna&#39s Arm</h1><p>Cragna was the Grand General of the Earth Elemental Armies during the second Elemental War. Great. Now that that&#39s out of the way, this ridge of mountains starts quite tall and very slowly tapers into foothills as it reaches its craggy fingers towards Mesa Rim.</p><p>It was formed after the infamous Sea Splitter maneuver that would eventually lead to the conclusion of the second Elemental War. You see, the entire earth army had built a veritable fortress out of the mountains in the center of the plane. An overwhelming force of water elements called The Kanagawa Correction split these forces into two groups and was forcing both of them out of their fortress.</p><p>Cragna knew this was an unwinnable battle and knew retreat was the only option. The portal back to the Earth Plane was at Mesa Rim and he had to get over 100,000 troops there yesterday. </p><p>However, Sea Splitter was a joint tactic. Fire elementals lay in wait for Cragna&#39s forces just at the base of the mountains. Due to the earth elementals natural superiority, the fire elementals could not enter the mountains, but had amassed enough strength to wipe out their forces should they be flushed out by, say, a huge force of water elementals.</p><p>It was an unwinnable situation. A real rock and a hard place. But Cragna is the only name remembered here for a reason. He tasked his men, all of them, with building their escape route. It was a ridge of relatively short peaks that would keep the fire elementals at bay whilst they retreated towards salvation. </p><p>But wait. Who would hold off the advancing water elementals? After all, if they didn’t leave the mountains, they&#39d be slaughtered by their natural superior. It all came down to one elemental.</p><p>One elemental would hold back an entire force of nature. One. Single elemental. Would forego tactics and give up his mind to hold back a force that had previously shattered mountains. One elemental would fight for 15 years non-stop to guarantee the safety of his men. One elemental would personally be responsible for over 20% of the souls sent to heaven during this one battle.</p><p>One elemental named General Goreshell Cragna.</p><p>Cragna stood as a wavebreak. An immovable wall. He was driven insane after the first year of battle, but that only made him all the stronger. What he did to those poor water elementals would later be classified as a war crime. “Excessive force” was a phrase first penned to describe the way he was fighting. He was an obdurate, impenetrable defense, but still mortal.</p><p>Cragna would meet his overdue demise at the hands of a final, desperate coalition of all three remaining armies. They had forgotten about his troops. This coalition was only formed to kill Cragna and Cragna alone. They barely succeeded.</p><p>In the end, every single one of Cragna’s troops made it back to the earth plane. He, however, was brutally executed, marking the end of the second Elemental War. </p><p>This ridge of mountains still stands as a testament to the undisputable power of Earth Elementals and their mastery of the word “unbreakable.” Though it never reached Mesa Rim, it didn’t matter. It served its purpose and saved the lives of 100,000 elementals.</p><p>Nowadays the only thing interesting about this line of peaks is Daigaku Hall, how it influences the migrations of modern elementals, and how rich in ore it is.</p>';

The rock of the mountain is only inches thick in certain places, and acts merely as a sheet to hide the true metropolis shrouded beneath the barren cliffs. These aren&#39t just caves, they&#39re the ruins of a city. </p><p>During the height of the Second Elemental War the grand earth elementals of old essentially abandoned their home plane and populated the material plane with a near infinite supply of Masons. </p><p>Of course, these crafty elementals got to work. They labored obsessively for the entirety of the war. The prevailing ideal was that the earth elementals would win the war no matter what, and the design of the ruins show that.</p><p>There are enough homes to fit every elemental ever crafted up to that point, and all were hand-carved works of art. Amenities were plumbed that would not become standard again for a thousand years. </p><p>What&#39s left is a ruin worth any adventure&#39s time, but be warned. The earth elementals never left, and the Masons continue to maintain their art.</p>';

				article.innerHTML = '<h1>Velho Mal</h1><p>Volcanos? In my material plane? It&#39s more likely than you&#39d think.</p><p>This chain of islands represents the only known volcanic activity in the entire plane. Originally created due to a portal to the fire plane deep in its core that liquified the rock around it, it is unknown why it&#39s still erupting to this day. It has been over a thousand years since its creation and over 300 since the portal was closed and never once has it stopped erupting. This, of course, makes it a deeply intriguing topic of research.</p><p>Sadly little actual research has been done into its behavior. The surrounding sea is nigh impossible to navigate and the untold numbers of fire elementals that call these shores home make it a difficult destination. The last known visitors to this island were the legendary Muhafuz&#39s Men who went to close the portal that caused the islands to form. </p><p>Though we&#39ve not set foot on the belching islands doesn&#39t mean research has ceased. Brand new aerial footage shows sprawling cities made of pumice and ash carved from the gentle cliffs of the islands. These structures are theorized to have been made by the fire elementals themselves, hinting at a previously unknown level of intelligence. </p>';

Its year round snow and ice make for great skiing, and an artificial resort has been built on the site to serve these wealthy patrons. </p><p>Of course, why it&#39s frozen over is a much more interesting topic of discussion.</p><p>Unlike a lot of phenomena in this plane, Lake Vash&#39s extreme temperatures can very easily be explained. You see, not too long ago (approx. 100 - 150 years) an archeological dig site was set up on Wolfwood Peninsula to uncover what had been causing strange planar readings in the area. Newly invented planar detectors were constantly going off in essentially the entire area, and the recently completed City B was raring to get to the bottom of why. </p><p>Through rigorous scientific study it was determined an ancient and insanely massive earth elemental was slain here, a beast that was truly remarkable. Optimistic estimates place this beast at a Class 0, and more accurate estimates place it at an unheard of Class -2! This creature&#39s bones were made of pure diamond, shrouded in some sort of carbon-rich rock not dissimilar to lignite. It takes the form of some six-winged wyrm and would have had a wingspan of over ten miles on its largest set.</p><p>Impressive in size alone, its raw power must have been unimaginable. Archeologists date these bones to the early Chaos Era, a time long before portals or other means of inter-ring travel. This means this beast, known locally as the Crystal Wyrm, would have been an unimaginably devastating force in its home plane.</p><p>But for reasons unknown, it ended its life here in the Material.</p><p>Back to why this relates to Lake Vash, the archeologists discovered the core of the Crystal Wyrm and found it to be producing an unearthly chill. The surface of the core sat at nearly absolute zero, but not only that a psychic phenomena would make you feel colder just thinking about it. City B&#39s plan was to use this as the core of the next generation runic reactor that would power the then-only-pipedream City C. </p><p>Sadly, the core was cracked upon extraction, and it began spewing frozen air into the atmosphere around it. Try as it might, City B was unable to contain the now forming blizzard, and was forced to retreat. 5 years later the system had stabilized and a permanent winter wonderland was left in its wake. </p>';

			case "cursed":
				article.innerHTML = '<h1>Cursed Isles</h1><p>The story of the Cursed Isles is one steeped in tragedy. Honestly unremarkable strips of sand pinned against the edge of the plane, these islands were utterly insignificant for most of their history. However they would soon become the epicenter for a grand holy war that would consume and destroy what little peace their irrelevance brought them. </p><p>It all started on the south island. Worshippers of the God of Injustice were constructing a portal to allow demons and devils to pour into the plane and seed distrust and evil. This was the first portal to ever be attempted, and was known as Hell Maw after its completion. </p><p>Worshippers of the God of Justice caught wind of the construction and planned to counter with a portal of their own. “It was to be purely defensive,” they justified. They would close it the second the demon scum were wiped from the plane and their evil portal closed. They ended up doing neither of those things. </p><p>The portals ended up opening within hours of each other and within hours of that a war unlike any this plane had ever seen ensnared the islands. </p><p>Godlike beings emerged from their portals at full power and laid waste to any that would oppose them. Demons were tuned to ash and angles reduced to dust. Soon even the gods sat atop the dias couldn&#39t keep away from the allure of all-out war and began using this conflict to solve petty disputes.</p><p>A holy proxy war raged and burned as the power spewing from the portals began corrupting the world around them. It was slow at first, but as the scale of the creatures pulled into the war increased the Material Plane began to crack. Creatures native to the islands mutated beyond recognition, an ever expanding circle of death and decay began to emanate from the demon&#39s portal and a thick pink ooze began to generate around the angel&#39s portal. This ooze soon became known as Kai’s Curse and it incinerated the souls of mortals who touched it. </p><p>Finally, around the turn of the era the infinite war was turned finite when Muhafuz single handedly closed both portals. This was their first act to close the Material Plane to invaders and sent shockwaves through the world. </p><p>The islands were left cursed and destitute. They now stand as a testament to the horrors of inter-ring war and the awe-inspiring power that was Muhafuz.</p>';

			case "collapse":
				article.innerHTML = '<h1>Great Collapse</h1><p>After the tactically amazing Sea Splitter maneuver during the second Elemental War, the tattered armies of the earth elementals were without their revered General Cragna. Lost and confused, the poor soldiers did the only thing they knew how, they built a mountain. While the bulk of forces were dealing with the actual and legendary Cragna, these aimless troops down south were left to their devices and they built the Great Canyon Fortress. This proved a tactically sound move, as they were able to stay in the Material Plane for much longer, but that was not to last. </p><p>Unknown to them, they had built a giant mountain directly on top of a portal to the Underdark. Very soon the entire Fortress collapsed to about a third of its original height and opened deep canyons that delved directly into the Underdark. This caused panic amongst the troops, but again, unknown to them, only solidified their position. </p><p>They had essentially created an impenetrable fortress surrounded by miles deep trenches and as such, prolonged the Elemental War until the Earth Portal was destroyed. </p><p>But! The troops never left. Though closed off from their plane they had created an ideal habitat for their kind. As with most elementals, they began to regress mentally without access to their plane&#39s power, so the earth elementals of legend that built this structure are sadly mindless beasts now. Though lost, they still continue to populate the arid mesa and have turned it from a decent habitat into a veritable oasis for earth kind. </p>';

			case "dregs":
				article.innerHTML = '<h1>Pirullinen Dregs</h1><p>The Dregs are an interesting swamp. Originally formed when the Vertei Sea was filled in, this mass of slow-moving, nutrient-rich water feeds an incredibly diverse ecosystem of magically infused beasts. </p><p>Fed by the magic waters of the Sylaln&#39t, the plants and animals here are uniquely evolved to take advantage of the inherent magic from the lake. Though they receive less magic per liter than the plants right on the shores, the much slower flow rate still allows the plants here to achieve a similar density of magic in their tissues.</p><p>This, in turn, feeds the magical beasts that roam this bayou. Everything from super-sized normal beasts to true freaks of nature can be found here. It is unknown truly how many species reside in the swamp, but the catalog of animals already documented is vast. From crocodiles the size of buses to leeches that teleport themselves inside of you, time will only tell what brave adventurer discovers the next oddity. Hopefully not by becoming its next meal.</p><p>Such a vast quantity of giant beasts makes this swamp a popular destination for trophy hunters. However, tribes of elven warriors who have aligned themselves with the will of the swamp also roam these waters. These nomadic peoples are less like the clean, pristine elves of the north and more like homeless men covered in mud clothed only in leaves. It is unknown what makes them able to grow beards, but interviewed tribesmen simply said, “The swamp willed it.” They are a people of few words, so truly little is known of their customs.</p><p>However we do know these elves go a step further to spite their ancestors and never bathe. When born, they are bathed exactly once in the waters of Sylaln&#39t, then return to the swamp to live a life aligned with a true natural wonder. Scholars have called these tribes people the “true elves” since, while forest elves came first chronologically, they warp their natural world to their will, while the swamp elves live a life completely governed by the natural lands they protect.</p>';

It is a holy site, a place of worship for a people steeped deeply in tradition. </p><p>Eons of worship and reverence have turned this puddle of meltwater into a spring of holy power that spills from the blessed walls of the Dias. It is used in local customs and is visited yearly by all elves. Bathing in the waters is said to be the closest a mortal can get to being a god, and the very water glows an unearthly, radiant blue. It is often blamed for the longevity of the elven people. </p><p>Its magical waters feed the great Sustentar Forrest, allowing trees to rival the very mountains whose foothills they root in. </p>';

Very few species with a soul live here, in fact. </p><p>We&#39ll get back to that. In the very center of the forest sits a truly massive tree. This is the namesake of the forest and it’s named after the being that summoned it, one Islar Cordredate. The tree has a maximum height of a measured 400 feet, however, its limbs stretch a mind boggling 1,227 miles at its widest. It is a living organism, so it is still growing. Islar&#39s roots are theorized to stretch directly into the Underdark and there is even evidence it anchors itself into the Feywild.</p><p>So, with all this natural magic stuff going on, why no elves? Well to put it lightly this was the site of a great tragedy. One that still strikes visitors with a deep and incredible sadness. </p><p>During the second Elemental War an unstoppable earth elemental named Cragna the Unmoving went on a rampage after a tactically genius maneuver split his army into two.  For 15 years he raged beyond reason, and the other three armies knew this war would not cease until he was dead. They entered a tentative agreement, and began to plan his assassination.</p><p>Firstly, they lured him away from the mountains. This was a costly maneuver as the crazed Cragna gave chase and all three armies were now on the backfoot. But they persisted. They drew Cragna as far as they could away from the earth elemental portal and directly next to the water portal. </p><p>Secondly, all out war. Every single elemental and anyone else they could recruit would open fire on Cragna and finally cease his terror. This did not go well.</p><p>Cragna was known as the Unmoving for very good reason and he began laying waste to the forces that opposed him. It was genocide. Soon the three armies were no longer on the offensive, but fighting like hell solely to survive. Worse yet, they had led Cragna directly to the water portal. Should he succeed in this battle, he could march directly into the Plane of Water and destroy their Wellspring, killing every water elemental and removing a god from the dias.</p><p>This was the end-game.</p><p>In the end it was not an elemental who stopped Cragna, but a single elf. Islar Cordredate was a recently wed prodigy sorcerer, who excelled in the magic of her fathers. She had proved to be a boon of power on the battlefield as her roots seemed to be the only thing able to pierce Cragna&#39s hide. Much of the later plans to kill Cragna revolved around getting Islar close, but she was never able to do enough damage to deal the final blow.</p><p>She fought this battle for her home, an ancestral elven forest that had been paved over by Cragna’s men as they built Cragna&#39s arm. She had recently remarried her soul-mate, an elf named Eigler. She fought to avenge her fallen homeland and to protect Eigler.</p><p>Fate would not be kind to Islar.</p><p>Troop numbers were dwindling, thousands of elementals deserted the force by the day, it was a lost cause. Cragna was too powerful. A force of nature. Unfair. Islar knew she could never kill such a savage monster, but she could trap it.</p><p>Islar poured her soul into her final spell. She spent days meditating, casting, preparing, anything to make sure her final spell worked. The last vestiges of the resistance went all in on Islar. She had to succeed. They held Cragna off for a further five days until the spell was ready.</p><p>Islar killed herself that day. Once her soul was unbound it was ensnared by her own spell. It bound her to Cragna. It began to tear him apart. Roots sprung from his core and anchored Cragna to the earth. He tore and ripped and screamed by his very being was channeled into the tree ensnaring him. Islar had sacrificed her immortal soul to cage Cragna. To end him.</p><p>It was a brutal end to Cragna. Some say he&#39s still alive in there, being tortured endlessly as his very resistance strengthens his prison. The battle was won, but none celebrated.</p><p>Islar had given up everything. She would never see her love again, she would never reincarnate, and her soul would forever be bound to Cragna. She made the ultimate sacrifice, and her tree stands as a tombstone to her dreams. </p><p>Any being with a soul will intrinsically feel this overbearing loss upon entering the forest. A guttural, almost animal sadness strikes those who enter. Though beautiful, this is not a place of honor. It is a graveyard.</p>';
