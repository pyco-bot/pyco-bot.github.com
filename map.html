				article.innerHTML = '<h1>Vestian Sea</h1><p>The Vestian was a good sea. Known to sailors as literally, “The Good Sea” it brought a boon of commerce between G&#39dush and the grand, sprawling cities that used to crowd against the edge of the ring. </p><p>Of course, these edge cities are long gone. So thorough was their destruction after the era changed not even their names remain. </p><p>The Vestian Sea harbors exuberant fauna and colorful and carefree flora. There is little danger here, and an overall attitude of sun, smiles, and the simple-life prevails.</p><p>Of course, this peace did not come easily. These waters are fiercely protected by sirens, water weirds, elementals, hell even schools of predatory fish patrol the sea to keep it as idyllic as ever. Ill-wishers on the sea are executed without trial. Littering here carries a death sentence. </p><p>Despite the danger, the peaceful shores and fragrant ocean air make this a great vacation spot for those willing to abide by the rule. Leave no trace.</p>';
				break;
			case "angreifen":
				article.innerHTML = '<h1>Angreifen Sea</h1><p>The Angreifen Sea is a terror. Sailors swear it&#39s alive, and some worship it to keep their ships afloat. Its untapped depths hold horrors unknown. Its terrifying storms can spring up in an instant. Its powerful currents divert ships and keep the entire sea absolutely frigid. </p><p>Of course, the sea isn’t actually alive. Though the water elementals that call it home may argue, there is no being in control of this sea’s terror. It&#39s all science! You see the Angreifen was made to be the deepest sea after a portal into the Underdark collapsed, bringing several thousand miles of tunnels and caves into the material plane. These structures collapsed under the weight of the primordial sea, and we’re left with the deep, frigid sea we know today.</p><p>But that’s only half the story. Enter Velho Mal, the only active volcanic system in the entire plane. This belching trio of islands perpetually generate hot, dry air and warm waters that, when clashed with the frigid sea beyond, create monstrous storms. Pair that with a usually warm and dry summer, and you can start to see why it’s been nicknamed Storm Mother by the dwarves of Festung and Créche Tempête by the scholars of Daigaku.</p><p>Little has been explored of its vast depths. After the horrors found in the deep of the Water Plane, most researchers decided it wasn’t worth finding out. Those crazy enough to venture deep, and lucky enough to come back, tell stories of vast underwater caverns filled with unimaginably beautiful creatures that dance in the watery light of gigantic glowing jellyfish. In the same breath these adventurers will also describe a gigantic creature that uses its ribs to grab and dismember prey. It’s good to remember the balancing rule of nature, for everything breathtakingly beautiful, there is something equally horrific. </p>';
				break;
			case "ost":
				article.innerHTML = '<h1>Ost Sea</h1><p>The Ost Sea has long been nicknamed the “Sea of Curses.” I mean, Gaifal&#39s Folly and both Cursed Isles are all here. Despite its neighbors, the Ost Sea is quite calm. Due to the curse on Gaifal&#39s Folly, the sea is drawn in predictable, peaceful patterns. It&#39s not too deep either. Without much geologic activity for several eras, the bottom of the Ost Sea is a plain, boring old desert dotted with the odd coral reef. </p><p>Wildlife in the area has suffered due to the corruption of the Cursed Isles, but data shows the effect to be slowly fading. Either way, the Ost Sea is a warm, calm ocean sparser than most. About as lame as an ocean can be. But not the lamest. That illustrious title goes to the Vertei Sea.</p>';
				break;
			case "vertei":
				article.innerHTML = '<h1>Vertei Sea</h1><p>What is there even to say man. This ENTIRE OCEAN is 20ft deep at its deepest. That&#39s it. Lake Vash is deeper. </p><p>To describe the Vertei Sea is to describe a tepid swimming pool. Its shores are small cliffs that immediately start you in about 3ft of water, then it rolls and rolls for what seems like eternity. The water is near stagnant and crystal clear. This makes it the ideal place for large schooling fish to swarm in masses, and indeed they do. The most interesting thing you&#39ll see out here is the miles wide schools that meander from seagrass patch to seagrass patch. There are few predators, but the ones that do patrol are to be respected. See Sandshark and Flatailed Stiltbird for more details.</p><p>Why is it like this? The First Elemental War of course! With no natural geologic activity the Material Plane relies on mainly earth elementals to shape its lands. And shape they did. During the war, water elementals used this sea as a base of operations. This was still during the first era, so the God of Earth at the time was, to put it gently, not smart. </p><p>They decided to finish this war once and for all by completely filling the enemy base with rocks. Their plan to end the war. Was to fill in the ocean. And I&#39ll be damned. That crazy son of a bitch pulled it off.      They lost the war.</p><p>However! That long forgotten god&#39s testament to the obdurate nature of the humble earth elemental has stood the test of time. Their resolute nature even in the face of certain defeat is deeply commendable, and this monument to their power isn’t even HALF as impressive as the mountains I mean come on dude Mount Cydical reaches halfway up the plane and houses countless gem dragons. This ocean blows.</p>';

				article.innerHTML = '<h1>Ruins of G&#39Dush</h1><p>G&#39Dush was the liaison between the resource rich center, and the grand cities at the edge of the plane. As such, it made its fortune shipping ore and timber downstream. And what a fortune it was.</p><p>Having essentially a monopoly on all the resources for an entire half of a plane leads to the accumulation of a bit of wealth. And what do you do with wealth? Build really sick vanity buildings of course! G&#39Dush soon became the center of culture and art and its towering skyscrapers pierced the heavens. For reference to the sheer vastness of the wealth generated here, the entirety of Daigaku Hall was constructed from the bankroll of exactly one company.</p><p>Of course, gilded cities always have a rotten center. The tri-opoly of corporations that owned the city ruled with an iron fist. Anti-competitive tactics were rampant in the industry and workers bore the brunt of these attacks. Class divides were laughably extreme. The elite even built a new road system suspended 20ft in the air to avoid interacting with their workers. G&#39Dush was essentially two cities, and luck determined which one you lived in.</p><p>In the end its exuberance was its downfall. At the turn of the era G&#39Dush sealed itself to the world, banking on stockpiled resources to make it through what was thought to be just a bad few years. But those bad few years happened to be just a bad few months. A worker&#39s revolt known as Red Winter saw the execution of each company&#39s president and board of directors. New leadership was shaky, and unable to stand against the tides of planar invaders.</p><p>Soon the gates were torn asunder and the city was looted for all it was worth. Within just a decade after the era change the city was essentially leveled. Today, the hollowed bones of bygone buildings warn against the viciousness of greed.</p>';

			case "gaifal":
				article.innerHTML = '<h1>Gaifal&#39s Folly</h1><p>Who&#39s Gaifal? Not important. These are the ruins of the once great capital of the Ostodaifal Empire. Who are they? Not important. These ruins were destroyed by an ancient water elemental named Dropour. Why did they destroy it? Not important.</p><p>What IS important is why wizards and other magic-folk still travel to it. You see Dropour&#39s spell has somehow manifested itself into some kind of self-perpetuating curse. Originally, Dropour simply wanted to use his mastery of magic to destroy the city, originally named Ostedge, with a giant wave. And they did! A single 100ft wave came crashing down on Ostedge, completely leveling anything not made of stone. </p><p>Originally, the ancient denizens of Ostedge planned to just stay. The keep and the walls were still up, so what was there to worry about? Well, the next day another wave came. And then another. Day after day veritable tsunamis battered the ruined walls of Ostedge.</p><p>After not even 3 days the entire empire was out for Dropour&#39s head. And they got it the very next day. Being that they were in a deep meditative trance, the warriors of Ostodaifal had no problem dispatching Dropour. But the waves never stopped. In fact, they began to increase in frequency. Soon the now ruined Ostedge was getting doused by several giant waves daily, but that wasn’t all. Coral began to grow unnaturally quick on the thrashed brickwork. Fish began swimming out of the sea and into the air as if there was no difference. Standing in what was once a bustling marketplace a week ago was now like standing at the bottom of the ocean. </p><p>But why? Well dear reader, no one knows. Scholars and wizards and all types are still making research missions to the ruin to try and find out why the sea has continued to lay stake to this ruin. What sort of magic is sustaining this ecosystem? Why did the waves stop increasing in frequency? Are the fish flying, or still swimming? </p><p>Many unanswered questions. However, here&#39s one more. Why are spells more powerful inside the ruin? </p><p>Inside the walls of Gaifal&#39s Folly is some magical source that increases the effectiveness of spells. No matter the caster, spell, casting method, or deity the spell is always stronger than even if it was cast right outside the walls. This feature makes the ruin a boon to magical research since the boosted base power helps casters practice higher level spells that they might not have been able to cast otherwise. Professor Kyoju has reportedly been able to cast an 11th level spell here. The gods were not pleased.</p>';

It&#39s more likely than you&#39d think.</p><p>This chain of islands represents the only known volcanic activity in the entire plane. Originally created due to a portal to the fire plane deep in its core that liquified the rock around it, it is unknown why it&#39s still erupting to this day. It has been over a thousand years since its creation and over 300 since the portal was closed and never once has it stopped erupting. This, of course, makes it a deeply intriguing topic of research.</p><p>Sadly little actual research has been done into its behavior. The surrounding sea is nigh impossible to navigate and the untold numbers of fire elementals that call these shores home make it a difficult destination. The last known visitors to this island were the legendary Muhafuz&#39s Men who went to close the portal that caused the islands to form. </p><p>Though we&#39ve not set foot on the belching islands doesn&#39t mean research has ceased. Brand new aerial footage shows sprawling cities made of pumice and ash carved from the gentle cliffs of the islands. These structures are theorized to have been made by the fire elementals themselves, hinting at a previously unknown level of intelligence. </p>';

			case "vash":
				article.innerHTML = '<h1>Lake Vash</h1><p>Lake Vash is a wonderful vacationing spot highly sought after by the elite and really anyone who can afford to keep the creatures away. Its year round snow and ice make for great skiing, and an artificial resort has been built on the site to serve these wealthy patrons. </p><p>Of course, why it&#39s frozen over is a much more interesting topic of discussion.</p><p>Unlike a lot of phenomena in this plane, Lake Vash&#39s extreme temperatures can very easily be explained. You see, not too long ago (approx. 100 - 150 years) an archeological dig site was set up on Wolfwood Peninsula to uncover what had been causing strange planar readings in the area. Newly invented planar detectors were constantly going off in essentially the entire area, and the recently completed City B was raring to get to the bottom of why. </p><p>Through rigorous scientific study it was determined an ancient and insanely massive earth elemental was slain here, a beast that was truly remarkable. Optimistic estimates place this beast at a Class 0, and more accurate estimates place it at an unheard of Class -2! This creature&#39s bones were made of pure diamond, shrouded in some sort of carbon-rich rock not dissimilar to lignite. It takes the form of some six-winged wyrm and would have had a wingspan of over ten miles on its largest set.</p><p>Impressive in size alone, its raw power must have been unimaginable. Archeologists date these bones to the early Chaos Era, a time long before portals or other means of inter-ring travel. This means this beast, known locally as the Crystal Wyrm, would have been an unimaginably devastating force in its home plane.</p><p>But for reasons unknown, it ended its life here in the Material.</p><p>Back to why this relates to Lake Vash, the archeologists discovered the core of the Crystal Wyrm and found it to be producing an unearthly chill. The surface of the core sat at nearly absolute zero, but not only that a psychic phenomena would make you feel colder just thinking about it. City B&#39s plan was to use this as the core of the next generation runic reactor that would power the then-only-pipedream City C. </p><p>Sadly, the core was cracked upon extraction, and it began spewing frozen air into the atmosphere around it. Try as it might, City B was unable to contain the now forming blizzard, and was forced to retreat. 5 years later the system had stabilized and a permanent winter wonderland was left in its wake. </p>';
